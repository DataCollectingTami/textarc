This is an attempt at a partial recreation of the amazing <a href="http://www.textarc.org/">TextArc</a> text visualization by W. Bradford Paley.

This is meant as a tribute to the pioneering work, and as an experiment in how one might implement such interactive visualizations using current open web technologies.
